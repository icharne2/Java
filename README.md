## Car Showroom Simulator

This project is a simple car showroom simulation implemented in Java using collections and object-oriented principles.  
It includes classes for managing multiple showrooms, adding/removing/searching vehicles, and calculating inventory statistics.  
The project was developed as part of a university lab assignment (Java Collections â€“ Lab 2, AGH 2024).

Key Features:
- Managing multiple car showrooms via a container class
- Tracking vehicles with conditions (NEW, USED, DAMAGED)
- Searching, sorting, and summarizing vehicle data
- Demonstration of Comparable and Comparator usage
