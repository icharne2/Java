A collection of Java algorithm implementations.

### Geometry Figures Calculator

This project implements a basic shape calculator in Java that supports 2D and 3D figures using object-oriented principles such as abstraction and interfaces.  
It includes an abstract base class for geometric figures (`Figure`), an interface for printable objects (`Printable`), and several implementations such as `Circle`, `Square`, `Triangle`, and `Prism`.  
The program calculates areas, perimeters, surface areas, and volumes, and allows for user interaction through a simple console menu.

Key Concepts Used:
- Interface (`Printable`)
- Abstract class (`Figure`)
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Exception handling for invalid inputs
- Separation of logic and UI components (clean architecture)


## Car Showroom Simulator

This project is a simple car showroom simulation implemented in Java using collections and object-oriented principles.  
It includes classes for managing multiple showrooms, adding/removing/searching vehicles, and calculating inventory statistics.  
The project was developed as part of a university lab assignment (Java Collections â€“ Lab 2, AGH 2024).

Key Features:
- Managing multiple car showrooms via a container class
- Tracking vehicles with conditions (NEW, USED, DAMAGED)
- Searching, sorting, and summarizing vehicle data
- Demonstration of Comparable and Comparator usage
